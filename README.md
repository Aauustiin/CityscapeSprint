# CityscapeSprint
Bright and cheery momentum based platformer that's simple to beat and impossible to perfect.

Development Roadmap

Preproduction
Goals
Get the core of the game (the movement) feeling as good as possible.
Set up the game structure such that I can easily add levels (I'll probably want to add a world select and a level select).
Add the systems that are essential to my MVP, and that are common to all levels (save game, bronze/silver/gold medal system, options menu).
Heavily playtest the core of the game.
Production
Create all the content, this will mainly be levels, but also things like completion bonuses and other pieces of content that aren't used throughout the whole game.
Playtest everything as I go to make sure it's fun.
Make a bunch of levels
Release
Create things like steam achievments, steam cloud saving system, steam trading cards, and steam store page graphics.
